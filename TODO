Feature
- How to handle recurrent events
- Add delete from google: search for cancelled (only in period of time?)
- Add color from google to notion


Improvements
- Create Event class for deriving
- Move self._cfg and time somehow out of classes
- Use delete as property instead of search separately
- empty notion page cannot determine notion_specific columns
- Fix warning error: display name of event

Bugs
- Forbidden:
googleapiclient.errors.HttpError: <HttpError 403 when requesting returned "Forbidden". Details: "[{'domain': 'global', 'reason': 'forbidden', 'message': 'Forbidden'}]">

- Birthdays dates get screwed

- Change of calendar in notion
